###Type:
- Mini-Project

###Prerequisites:
- Ruby
  - Objects/Classes
  - Initializer
  - Accessors
  - gets.chomp
  - Multi-file projects ('require')

###Objectives:
- Practice creating objects

###Activity:
- Work on this lab in pairs
- There is a spec folder containing tests on each model. 
  - Make sure these tests pass before moving on.

###Explanation
- You are the manager at HappiTails animal shelter. You need to manage your
shelter by storing and manipulating information about clients and animals.
- Make git commits as you finish each phase, so you can see the history

###Starter Code

- You are given some code and and files to get yourself started
  - **main.rb**
    - This is the file you will use to run your program with `ruby main.rb`
    - This is the file that will be responsible for prompting users, and taking input
  - **data.rb**
    - You do not need to write or change any code in this file but you may want to look at it
    - Once you have created your classes this file will seed your program with data
  - **animal.rb, client.rb, shelter.rb**
    - These files are for your classes
    - animal.rb has some code started for you, but the other classes you'll have to create from scratch
  - **spec**
    - These are your rspec tests to help ensure your program is working properly
    - To run all your specs run `rspec` in your teminal
    - To run a specific set of specs run `rspec spec/<filename>` in your terminal, i.e. `rspec spec/animal_spec.rb`
